### Cat and Dog Image Classifier

## Introduction
This project is a simple image classification model built using TensorFlow to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to classify images as either a cat or a dog. This project uses a dataset provided by freeCodeCamp.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-dog-classifier.git
cd cat-dog-classifier
```
2. Download the dataset:
```bash
wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip
unzip cats_and_dogs.zip
```
3. Run the Python script to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
python cat_dog_classifier.py
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification

## Training
The model is trained using the training set with the following configurations:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: 15
- Batch size: 128

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set using accuracy and loss metrics. Additionally, the model is tested on a separate test set to determine its generalization ability.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation set. Detailed results, including loss and accuracy plots, are generated during the training process.
